 Here are some more details of the requirements.
1.	SimpleBlackJack will be played by the dealer (the computer) and one player.
2.	Ace will be counted as 1 or 11; King, Queen, and Jack will all be counted as 10. The other cards will be counted at pip value. 
3.	The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. 
4.	A "blackjack" is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card (Queen, King, or Jack), and it outranks all other 21-point hand.
5.	The dealer will give two cards to the player and two cards to herself. Both the player’s and the dealer’s card-pair will be shown face-up.
..*	If the player has a blackjack, then the player wins the game. 
..*	If the dealer has a blackjack, then the player looses the game. 
..*	If both the player and the dealer have blackjacks, then it is a tie. 
6.	The player will have the first turn.  He can go for Hit or Stop. 
7.	Hit: Player touches a button title Hit, which draws another card. If this card causes the player's total points to exceed 21 (known as "breaking" or "busting") then he loses. A player can at most push Hit 3 times after the first two cards that were drawn. Thus there will be at most 5 cards drawn by the player.
8.	After 3 Hits, the Hit button should be disabled for the Player.
9.	Stop: The player may choose to stop at any point after the initial two cards and before the three Hits i.e. before the drawing of the three new cards. When the 3 cards are drawn, it will become the dealer’s (i.e., the Computer’s) round. 
10.	Dealer can also draw up-to three new cards. Dealer’s drawing will be automatic (no pressing of Hit is needed). Once the dealer has either gone bust, stopped or have drawn all three cards, the app will show result of the game, which will be one of the following three scenarios:
..*	The Player has won
..*	The Dealer has won
..*	The round is a Tie
11.	SimpleBlackJack will have a “New Game” button that starts a new game. The player can hit the “New Game” Button at any time. If this button is hit in the middle of the game, it will cancel the current game and start a new one.
